# Cylo (AgricCylo)
Cylo is a decentralized payment platform built on Starknet, enabling farmers and consumers to trade farm produce directly, peer-to-peer, without middlemen, by leveraging the blockchain's speed, transparency, and trustlessness. Cylo empowers farmers to earn up to 40% more with fast payouts, while consumers save up to 20% on fresher produce. With a low 2.5% fee, a user-friendly app, Cylo tackles especially small farmerholders' agro-market pain points, viz, middlemenâ€™s 40% cuts, delayed payments, and inflated prices. Designed for smallholder farmers, Cylo fosters trust and efficiency, scaling from pilot to a global powerhouse in the World's agro market.
